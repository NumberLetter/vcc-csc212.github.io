<p>In a flipped classroom, <strong>students learn the material on their own</strong> via videos and readings, and use the time in class to ask questions, practice, and apply their knowledge. In a flipped classroom there is <strong>little to no lecturing in class</strong> and you, as a student, have more control and <strong>full responsibility over your learning</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="why-flip-it">Why flip it?</h4>
<p>We don’t get a lot of time together so why use that precious time to tell you things you can hear and read on your own? I rather use the little time we have together to answer your questions and help you get unstuck while working on assignments.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-i-thrive-in-this-setting">How do I thrive in this setting?</h4>

<h5 id="at-home"><em>At home:</em></h5>
<p>You must <strong>complete the material before class</strong> and come in to class <strong>with questions</strong> if you have them (and you should have them). The more questions you have, the more help I can be! <strong>Take good notes</strong> as you read– you’ll thank yourself later!</p>

<h5 id="in-class"><em>In class:</em></h5>
<p><strong>Ask questions</strong>! Learning happens when you engage with the material and that means asking clarifying questions, application questions, and extension questions. There’s <strong>no such thing as a dumb question</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="so-whats-your-role-as-an-instructor">So what’s your role as an instructor?</h4>
<p>You’ll notice I don’t record lectures much; instead, I curate the best resources (videos and readings) I can find (because why re-invent the wheel) and spend a lot of time designing activities and assignments for you to practice. Computer Science is not something that can be learned just by reading or watching material– <strong>you need to practice and apply it</strong>! That’s where I come in– to give you and guide you through the practice and application of what you’re reading and watching.</p>
