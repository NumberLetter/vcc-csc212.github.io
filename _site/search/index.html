						"url": " /why-prep/",
						"content": "Why do I need to do work before the semester? It’s break! Generally speaking, the data structures and algorithms course is one of the toughest for CS majors (across universities, not just at URI). This course should put together your problem solving and programming skills and push you to think beyond short and disjointed code– enabling you to think through and solve large-scale and real-world problems. Because the topics we’re going to cover are already challenging in it of themselves, it’s important you come in as prepared as possible so you don’t have to play catch up while learning new material. Okay fine, but do I have to? Reviewing the material below before the start of the semester is strongly recommended for all students especially if: You didn’t do too hot on 211 This is your first C++ course Pointers aren’t your strong suit Object oriented programming is still confusing You haven’t taken or will be concurrently taking MTH 180 Alright, fine, where do I start? The prep work page contains some resources you may find useful in preparing for the course."

					"flipped": {
						"id": "flipped",

						"category": "",
						"url": " /flipped/",
						"content": "What’s a flipped classroom? In a flipped classroom, students learn the material on their own via videos and readings, and use the time in class to ask questions, practice, and apply their knowledge. In a flipped classroom there is little to no lecturing in class and you, as a student, have more control and full responsibility over your learning. Why flip it? We don’t get a lot of time together so why use that precious time to tell you things you can hear and read on your own? I rather use the little time we have together to answer your questions and help you get unstuck while working on assignments. How do I thrive in this setting? At home: You must complete the material before class and come in to class with questions if you have them (and you should have them). The more questions you have, the more help I can be! Take good notes as you read– you’ll thank yourself later! In class: Ask questions! Learning happens when you engage with the material and that means asking clarifying questions, application questions, and extension questions. There’s no such thing as a dumb question. So what’s your role as an instructor? You’ll notice I don’t record lectures much; instead, I curate the best resources (videos and readings) I can find (because why re-invent the wheel) and spend a lot of time designing activities and assignments for you to practice. Computer Science is not something that can be learned just by reading or watching material– you need to practice and apply it! That’s where I come in– to give you and guide you through the practice and application of what you’re reading and watching."
