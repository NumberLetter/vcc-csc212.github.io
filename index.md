#### Intro to the course
Data structures and algorithms is arguably **the most important course you'll take** in Computer Science. From [getting internships and job offers](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig) to [preparing for advanced courses](https://www.synergisticit.com/how-data-structures-and-algorithms-are-important-for-computer-science-graduates/), understanding data structures and algorithms is what differentiates programmers and coders from computer scientists and engineers.
