Data structures and algorithms is arguably **the most important course you'll take** in Computer Science. From [getting internships and job offers](https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig) to [preparing for advanced courses](https://www.synergisticit.com/how-data-structures-and-algorithms-are-important-for-computer-science-graduates/), understanding data structures and algorithms is what differentiates programmers and coders from computer scientists and engineers.

#### What will I learn in this course?
Upon successful completion of the course, you should be able to:
- Implement and use basic algorithms and data structures
- Implement algorithmic solutions using the appropriate data structures and algorithms 
- Compare different algorithms and data structures based on efficiency, using empirical and theoretical algorithm analysis techniques

#### What're the non-negotiables?
Each time we meet for lab or lecture, you'll be learning a new topic, for a grand total of about **40 topics** (that means **we move incredibly fast so don't fall behind**). Of those 40-ish topics, some of them will be review or preliminary knowledge required for understanding future topics. Taking that into account, the **new topics** we'll be covering can be categorized into **20 umbrella topics** (outlined below):

1. Recurrence Relations
2. `Sorting Algos`
3. `Dynamic Arrays & Amortized Analysis`
4. `Sets & Maps`
5. Hashtables	
6. `Linked Lists`
7. `Queues`
8. Priority Queues and Heaps	
9. `Stacks`
10. `Binary Search`
11. `Trees`
12. `BFS & DFS`
13. `Types of Algorithms`
14. Programming Approaches	
15. Tries	
16. Matrices	
17. `Graphs and Shortest Path`
18. `Combinations and Permutations`
19. `Space Complexity`
20. Parsing	

Of these 20, the `formatted` **13 are non-negotiable** which means that in order to pass the course, you **must** demonstrate at a minimum, a [level of understanding](/grading#grades) about them.
