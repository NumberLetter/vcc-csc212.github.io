#### Pre-Reading for Intro to Analysis of Algos, Tuesday 2/1 {#tues}

##### Essential Questions
Before attending class, please complete the material below and use the following questions to guide your note-taking:  
<br>
✔️ Why is time complexity important?  
✔️ What are the differences between Big-O, Big-Omega, and Theta?  
✔️ What is the process for analyzing the time complexity of an algorithm?  

##### Read/Watch/Review
Before attending class, please complete the material below:
- Read [Gaddis 9.6: Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms](/files/Gaddis-Algos.pdf)
- Watch [Analyzing Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gN6KCS_D4k) (15 min)
- Watch [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Yo7Kxa0vOU) (14 min)
- Explore [Common Complexities, Graphed](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/pdft1nieox)
	- When I say explore, I mean zoom in and out, add constants, compare values at small vs large x values, etc.
- Read [Asymptotic Notations](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/aysmptotic-notations)
- Watch [Asymptotic Bounding 101: Big O, Big Omega, & Theta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oDAlMwTrLo) (23 min)


##### In Class
In today's class we'll be analyzing and comparing the time complexity of simple algorithms. We'll also talk briefly about why we can't just manually time algorithms, and why asymptotic analysis is important.
